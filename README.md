## Documentation

Check the [docs](https://github.com/grafana/google-sheets-datasource/blob/main/src/README.md) for information on how to use the data source.

## Development guide

This is a basic guide on how to set up your local environment, make the desired changes and see the result with a fresh Grafana installation.

## Requirements

You need to install the following first:

- [Mage](https://magefile.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Running the development version

### Compiling the Backend

If you have made any changes to any `go` files, you can use [mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage) to recompile the plugin.

```sh
mage buildAll
```

### Compiling the Frontend

After you made the desired changes, you can build and test the new version of the plugin using `yarn`:

```sh
yarn run dev # builds and puts the output at ./dist
```

The built plug-in will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Docker Compose

To test the plug-in running inside Grafana, we recommend using our Docker Compose setup:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### Test spreadsheet
